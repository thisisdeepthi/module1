# Introduction

- NP-hard problem.

- Many approaches.
  - Exact and heuristic algos.
  - meta-heuristics lkind of heuristics.
  - Popular meta-heuristics.
    - Genetic algo(GA).
    - Tabu search(TS).
    - Simulated Annealing(SA).
    - Ant colony system.
    - Particle Swarm Optimisation etc.

## PSO

- Population-based search method.
- imitate the physical movement of individuals in swarm as searching method.

## Model Formulation

1. Problem Assumptions:

    - Customers demand and capacity of vehicles.
    - only one main centre where goods are loaded.
    - Transportation cost => fixed and variable cost.
    - totality of same type vehicles fixed.
    - depot a coordinate nd customers serviced by no of vehicles.

2. Mathematical model:

    - Transport cost => influenced by fuel consumption, maintainance etc and proportional to vehicle mileage.
